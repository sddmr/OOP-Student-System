**📌 Student Information System (C++ OOP Project)**

This project is a console-based Student Information System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming principles. It demonstrates class design, header/source file separation, encapsulation, pointers, and relationships between objects.

### 🚀 Features

* Add and manage students
* Assign advisors to students using object pointers
* Search students by:

  * Name
  * Surname
  * GPA (GANO) range
* List all students
* Clean OOP structure with separate `.h` and `.cpp` files

### 🧠 Concepts Used

* Classes and objects
* Constructors, getters, setters
* Pointers and object relationships (Student ↔ Advisor)
* `const` correctness
* STL containers (`std::vector`)
* Modular project structure

### 🛠️ Technologies

* Language: C++
* IDE: CLion
* Compiler: Clang (macOS)

### 📂 Project Structure

```
/ogrenci.h / ogrenci.cpp   -> Student class
/danisman.h / danisman.cpp -> Advisor class
/arama.h / arama.cpp       -> Search and management logic
/main.cpp                  -> Program entry point
```

### 🎯 Purpose

This project was created to strengthen my understanding of Object-Oriented Programming in C++ and to practice building real-world style class relationships.
